## Directories and files

Please look at the requirements file to learn about dependencies and useful packages to reproduce our results.

Directory __Code__ contains developing codes in jupyter notebook or python file format. In the _Spark_ folder in this directory contains the algorithm developed using pyspark.

Directory __Notebooks__ contains generated PDFs of jupyter notebooks we used to produce our report.

Directory __Data__ contains the small dataset from the full dataset.

## Our goal

Our business objective is to **recommend movies to users, and we choose those users who have already watched at least a few movies on the platform**. We want to make sure that movies that are recommended using our algorithm are interested by the users. 

## Data

Full dataset can be found here: [Full Movielens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ )

We then subsampled a smaller dataset from the full dataset to work on. 

## Result

Please see __final_report.pdf__
